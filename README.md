Scholar Recommendation Pipeline
This project involves the development of a Scholar Recommendation Pipeline designed to enhance link prediction accuracy within a knowledge graph framework. By leveraging advanced machine learning techniques, such as Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), and Knowledge Graph Reasoning, this pipeline improves data-driven decision-making for recommending academic scholars and identifying relationships between them.

Project Overview
In academic and research networks, identifying connections between scholars based on their research interests, publications, and collaborations can be challenging. This Scholar Recommendation Pipeline addresses that challenge by building a robust recommendation system that predicts and suggests connections between scholars. Our pipeline achieved a 10% increase in link prediction accuracy compared to traditional baseline models.

Features
Enhanced Link Prediction: The pipeline uses Graph Neural Networks (GNN) and RNN to model relationships and predict new connections between scholars.
Knowledge Graph Reasoning: By integrating knowledge graph reasoning techniques, the system can infer hidden relationships between nodes, improving recommendation quality.
Data-Driven Decision-Making: The improved link prediction accuracy allows for more informed decisions about potential collaborations and academic partnerships.
Technologies Used
Graph Neural Networks (GNNs): Employed to capture structural and relational information within the knowledge graph, providing insights into potential connections.
Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs): Used to process sequential data and improve model accuracy by capturing temporal patterns.
Knowledge Graphs: Built to represent relationships between scholars, including research interests, co-authorship, and citation networks.
PyTorch: The primary framework used for building, training, and optimizing machine learning models.
Data Sources
The pipeline was developed using a dataset of scholarly publications, including metadata about authors, research topics, and publication citations. The dataset was preprocessed to construct a knowledge graph, where nodes represent scholars and edges represent various relationships (e.g., co-authorship, shared research topics).

Methodology
Data Preprocessing: Raw data is cleaned and transformed into a structured format suitable for knowledge graph construction. Relationships between scholars are encoded as edges in the graph.
Model Training:
A Graph Neural Network (GNN) is used to capture complex relationships within the graph and learn embeddings for each scholar node.
An RNN model is incorporated to capture sequential patterns and enhance the temporal understanding of relationships.
Knowledge Graph Reasoning: The knowledge graph is iteratively updated by incorporating new relationships predicted by the model, enabling the system to infer indirect connections.
Link Prediction: The final model predicts potential connections between scholars, with the results compared against a baseline model to evaluate accuracy improvements.
Results
The Scholar Recommendation Pipeline successfully improved link prediction accuracy by 10% over baseline models, demonstrating the effectiveness of combining GNNs, RNNs, and knowledge graph reasoning for academic recommendations. This improvement allows for better identification of potential research collaborations and insights into scholarly networks.
